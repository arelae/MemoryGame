## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
w3schools.com

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
I think the most challenging part was to make sure that I was understanding everything that was asked of me and what I was writing. Since, I have taken a HTML, CSS, and JavaScript project based class, it wasn't
my first time seeing code like this. 
However, if there was some code that I just did not understand, going to resource websites such as w3schools was really helpful. Having examples and explanations to look at made it a lot easier to learn and
understand.

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
How do you know when to stick with vanilla JavaScript or using a framework? In my Software Engineering class that I just completed, the professor insisted that we use vanilla JavaScript to implement our web app.
I think the professor's decision to use pure JavaScript was really helpful for me and other students to learn the basics and have a good foundation. However, in the future I wonder when frameworks will be needed.
How do I/we know if going with a framework is more helpful or harmful? Harmful, in that, it makes a simple project more complicated than it has to be by adding dependents.

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
I would add a dark mode since light/dark mode has been very popular and lots of people like the option of switching between them. The player would be able to switch between the modes with a toggle button.
This would work mostly with JavaScript and CSS.
Another task I would work on would be a settings menu that would allow the user to set how many buttons they would like to play with and how long the pattern sequence should be. I think this task would be really
helpful with getting to know JavaScript more.
